# 👋 Hello there

I’m Raimon, a hybrid professional in **web development, digital marketing and project management**, with a background that combines **technical rigor, strategic vision and collaborative leadership**.

After more than a decade working in **communication, marketing and cultural management**, I’ve developed key skills: strategic planning, coordination of multidisciplinary teams, data-driven decision-making and effective communication between technical and creative areas. This experience has taught me to understand **projects from conception to execution, connecting people, processes and goals**.

In recent years, I’ve strengthened my technical profile as a **full-stack developer**, working with TypeScript and the MERN stack, applying testing, accessibility (a11y), CI/CD and Agile methodologies. This combination of experiences has allowed me to **bring together creativity, structure and technology** to create solid, results-oriented digital solutions.

I’m passionate about building useful and sustainable products, optimizing processes and facilitating communication between technical and business teams. I identify with **environments where technology, creativity and strategy converge**, and where teamwork, quality and purpose drive the final outcome.
