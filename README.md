# 👋 Hello there!

I'm a hybrid professional in **project management, digital marketing and web development**, with over ten years of experience leading teams, planning strategies and developing digital solutions from start to finish.

I combine the **technical rigor of a full-stack developer** (working with TypeScript, React, Node.js and Agile, TDD and CI/CD methodologies) with the **strategic and analytical vision of a marketing manager**, capable of connecting data, technology and business goals.

I've coordinated international projects, designed technical roadmaps, led multidisciplinary teams and driven efficiency and quality improvements. I'm passionate about bringing together **creativity, structure and technology** to generate real impact and build useful, accessible and well-crafted products.

In short: a versatile and **cross-functional profile** that integrates strategic vision, technical expertise and leadership ability, oriented toward results, innovation and continuous improvement.
