I'm a full-stack web developer. Not the smartest or the fastest, but playing it safe: checking every step, applying improvements and refactoring. I work with TypeScript, MERN stack, testing (YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO TEST) and best practices. I write behavior-and-accessibility driven code, object-oriented and with continuous integration and delivery.

🧰 Technologies and tools? Whatever it takes: Chalk, CLI, commitlint, CORS, CSS, Cypress, debug, dev tools, DOM, dotenv, ESLint, Express, Git, GitHub, Helmet, HTML, Husky, JavaScript, Jest, Lighthouse, lint-staged, MongoDB, Mongoose, Morgan, MSW, Netlify, Node.js, Postman, Prettier, React, React Hooks, Redux Toolkit, Render, SonarQube, SuperTest, Testing Library, TypeScript, Vite, Vitest, Wave…

🤔 I have abstraction and analytical skills. I am collaborative, communicative, creative and innovative. I have good emotional management and leadership skills. I am original, critical and proactive. I enjoy teamwork. I speak Catalan, Spanish, and English. I am fluent in spreadsheets and know how to use marketing (mailing, programmatic, monetization, etc.) and internal management tools.

🤓 Also: I have worked in online marketing for twelve years. I've been a manager, promoter, and producer in the music industry. I've coordinated volunteer teams at a film festival. I’ve worked voluntarily in associations (what is being in an association, if not volunteering?). I've even been a DJ and a graphic designer.

✅ To sum up: a full-stack developer with experience in digital marketing and a desire to make things that work (and people like).

Shall we talk? 🙃
