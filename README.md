# 👋 Hello there!

I'm a hybrid professional in **digital marketing, communication and web development, with over fifteen years' experience** leading teams, managing projects and developing end-to-end digital solutions.

My career **combines the technical rigour of a full-stack developer** (working with TypeScript, React, Node.js and Agile, TDD and CI/CD methodologies) **with the strategic vision of a marketing and communication manager**, capable of connecting data, technology and business objectives. Additionally, I carry the **cultural and associative sector close to my heart**: I've co-founded and chaired youth organisations, managed cultural projects and worked in institutional communication with public administrations.

I've coordinated international projects, designed technical roadmaps, led multidisciplinary marketing and development teams, driven efficiency and quality improvements, and managed relationships with public and private entities. I'm passionate about **bringing together creativity, structure and technology** to generate real impact, build useful and accessible products, and put communication and management at the service of collective objectives.

In summary: a **versatile and cross-functional profile that integrates strategic vision, technical capability, experience in communication and cultural management, and collaborative leadership**. Results-oriented, focused on innovation and continuous improvement, and committed to projects that have meaning and social impact.
