## Hi, how are you! 👋

🙋‍♀️ I'm a <b>full-stack web developer</b>. Not the smartest or the fastest, but playing it safe: checking every step, applying improvements and refactoring. <b>I work with TypeScript, MERN stack, testing</b> (YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO TEST) <b>and best practices</b>. I write <b>behavior-and-accessibility driven code</b>, <b>object-oriented</b> and with <b>continuous integration and delivery</b>.

🧰 Technologies and tools? Whatever it takes: Chalk, CLI, commitlint, CORS, <b>CSS</b>, Cypress, debug, dev tools, DOM, dotenv, ESLint, <b>Express</b>, Git, GitHub, Helmet, <b>HTML</b>, Husky, <b>JavaScript</b>, Jest, Lighthouse, lint-staged, <b>MongoDB</b>, Mongoose, Morgan, MSW, Netlify, <b>Node.js</b>, Postman, Prettier, <b>React</b>, <b>React Hooks</b>, <b>Redux Toolkit</b>, Render, SonarQube, SuperTest, Testing Library, <b>TypeScript</b>, Vite, Vitest, Wave…

🤔 I have abstraction and analytical skills. I am <b>collaborative, communicative, creative and innovative</b>. I have good emotional management and leadership skills. I am <b>original, critical and proactive</b>. I enjoy <b>teamwork</b>. I speak Catalan, Spanish, and English. I am fluent in spreadsheets and know how to use marketing (mailing, programmatic, monetization, etc.) and internal management tools.

🤓 Also: I have worked in <b>online marketing for twelve years</b>. I've been a manager, promoter, and producer in the <b>music industry</b>. I've coordinated volunteer teams at a film festival. I’ve <b>worked voluntarily in associations</b> (what is being in an association, if not volunteering?). I've even been a DJ and a graphic designer.

✅ To sum up: a <b>full-stack developer with experience in digital marketing</b> and a desire to make things that work (and people like).
